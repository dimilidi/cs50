1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

If the database songs.db contains the top 100 songs of a listener from 2018,
I could calculate their audio aura by calculating the average energy, valence, and danceability of the songs.

Average ENERGY of songs is 0.659.
-> The listener seems to enjoy moderately high-energy music. They like upbeat and intense music, but not too aggresive.

Average VALENCE of songs is 0.484.
-> This indicates a balance between positive and negative emotions in the listeners favourite music in 2018. They seems to like both happy and sad music

Average DANCEABILITY of songs is 0.716.
-> The high danceability score tells us that the lsitener enjoys rhythmic music that is easy to dance to.

In conclusion, the litener's audio aura could be described as energetic, emotionally balanced and rhythmic.


2. Hypothesize about why the Audio aura might not be very representative of the listener

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

The calculated audio aura might not fully represent the lsitener's music taste because:
- it is focusing only on three attributes (energy, valence, and danceability) and is not considering other important factors as genre, lyrics, tempo and so on.
- Spotify Wrapped is based on the top 100 most played songs, but the listener might have other favourite songs apart from these.

To improve the accuracy we need more detailed data like genre preference, listening habits, contextual information.
